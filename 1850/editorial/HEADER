  This directory contains the tunes from the O'Neill's Music of Ireland,  one
  tune  per  file.   You  can  search  for  a tune by name by going to the <a
  href="/~jc/music/abc/findtune.html">ABC tune finder</a> page and typing  in
  a title or fragment of a title.  The tunes flagged with an asterisk are the
  O'Neill's tunes.

<p>
  We are now inn the "proofreading"  phase,  and  everyone  with  a  copy  of
  O'Neill's is invited to examine any of the tunes that you download.  Please
  look up your favorite tunes, compare them with your (or a friend's) copy of
  O'Neill's,  and  <a  href="mailto:jc@trillian.mit.edu">send  in  the  error
  reports</a>.

<p>
  The file names  here  all  include  a  <a  href="Initials.html">2-character
  id</a> that indicates the file's source. Some of the tunes were transcribed
  by more than one person.  Eventually the duplicates should be merged.

<p>
  The original <b>O'Neill's Music of Ireland</b> has been  out  of  copyright
  for  many  years now.  This collection of ABC transcriptions is copyrighted
  1997-2000 by the contributors to the project.  You are welcome to  download
  anything  here  and use it, as long as you give credit to the transcribers,
  and take credit for any corrections or enhancements that you might make.

<p>
  Experimental gimmick:
    <a href="/~jc/cgi/abc/TuneList">Tune List</a> program
  lists all the tunes and provides conversion from ABC to various formats.
